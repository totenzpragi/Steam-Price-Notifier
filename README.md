# Steam-Price-Notifier
 Steam Price Monitor is an extension for the Google Chrome browser that makes it easy to track the price of items on the Steam Marketplace. With it, users can easily set a target price for the items they are interested in, and the extension will automatically notify them when the price drops below that value.
